possibly from a particular geolocation (e.g Malaysia) and get your telegram data. Limit
your data to 200 messages at maximum.

Assign and accumulate scores for each occurrence of the terms. You may
also define your own scoring method that make sense/applicable (e.g., scores between
the range of 0 – 1.0)
